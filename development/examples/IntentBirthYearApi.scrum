EPIC "BirthYearService"

    USER STORY "BirthYearApi"

        #INTENT
        I want to define an API endpoint that accepts a year as a parameter
        and returns the calculated birth year. The API should be called "BirthApi"
        with base path "/api/birth" and the endpoint should be a GET request
        at path "/birthyear/{year}" that returns the birth year.
        #END INTENT
